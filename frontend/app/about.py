        Our model was trained using a multitasking learning approach, where the convolutional
        neural netwok (CNN) processes X-rays through multiple epochs. An epoch represents
        one complete pass through the entire training dataset. During training, the CNN
        backbone extracts features from preprocessed images which are fed into three output
        heads, each responsible for bone age regression, gender classification and
        estimating the uncertainty levels.

        The figure below illustrates the model's performance over 50 epochs
        using loss and mean absolute error (MAE). These results highlight the effectiveness
        of thorough training, clean data and hyperparameter tuning, supporting our choice
        of regression for bone age estimation. Future work will focus on subgroup analysis
        and further improvements through data augmentation and ensemble methods, marking
